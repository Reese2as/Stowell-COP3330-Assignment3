          String for the list words as a string
          String[] for the array of words
          List of class words to take in the value from the class

Take in .txt file into List using a while loop and scanner

Set wordstring = to the list as a string using String.join
Set String[] = to the wordsring as an array using .split
Call function to count the words take in the string array set this equal to the list of class words

For (the size of the list of class words)
    print the word: taking the words from the class
        For(the frequency of each word)
            print *
    Print \n to go to next line

In function word counter
    Initialize List of class words to take in the value from the class
               Int that tracks whether the word taken in has been seen before

    For(the length of the string array)
        Set wordexists to 1
            For(the size of the list of class words)
            If(index of the String[] is = a word before
                Add 1 to the quantity value
                Set wordexists = 2
    If(wordexsits == 1)*
        create a temporary variable of class Words
        set the frequency of temporary variable to 1
        set the word of temporary variable to the word of the index i
        add the temp to the List of class words

return the list of class words

In Class Words
    hold an int for frequency
    hold a String for the word
    Create a function to return the word
